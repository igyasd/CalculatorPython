# CalculatorPython
Vaggos_Calculator
The most unnecessarily dramatic calculator ever created in Python using Tkinter.
It adds… it subtracts… it multiplies… it divides…
AND it has a secret message if you manage to summon the holy number 67.
What more could a calculator do? Cook dinner? Pay your taxes? No. But it will entertain you.

Features
➕ Basic Math
Add stuff.
➖ Remove stuff.
✖️ Make stuff bigger.
➗ Make stuff smaller.
Pretty straightforward.

🔢 Number Buttons
0–9 like every normal calculator, but these ones have ✨ vibes ✨.

🎯 Extra Spicy Math Options
% for when you want to feel like you're doing business math
. because decimals exist
( ) so you can pretend you understand advanced math
** because power feels… powerful 💥

🧼 Clear Button
Press it to make all your mistakes disappear — if only life had this feature 😭

🟰 Equals Button
Magically transforms your chaos into a final answer.
Usually.
Unless your chaos is too powerful.

🎉 SECRET EASTER EGG (yes really)
If you somehow, someway, somewhere manage to produce the number
✨ 67 ✨
the calculator will reveal a SECRET MESSAGE.
How do you hit 67?
Math.
Chaos.
Sheer luck.
Maybe divine intervention.
Try everything:

➖ * ➗ ( ) ** %
Just get 67 and BOOM 💥 surprise message.
Like unlocking a mini boss in a calculator.

User Interface Overview
📺 Display – where the magic (and mistakes) appear
🔢 Numbers – the digits you already know but now they look cooler for no reason
➕ ➖ ✖️ ➗ – the four horsemen of math
( ) – fancy math containers
. – the dot of destiny
🧽 Clear – wipe your sins
🟰 Equals – final judgment

How to Use

Press numbers. Amazing start.

Add operators like you're making a math sandwich.

Use parentheses if you want to feel clever.

Press "=" to see if the calculator approves.

Hit Clear when you inevitably regret everything.

Try to reach 67 and become a legend.

Example Calculations
5 + 7 (boring but respectable)
(10 * 3) - 5 (spicy)
8**2 (boom)
100 % 13 (corporate math)
(4 + 3) * (2 + 6) (fancy)
Something that gives you 67 (elite)

Requirements
🐍 Python 3.x
🖼️ Tkinter (already inside Python like a hidden treasure)

Or irresponsibly.
Your choice. 😎
